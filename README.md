# Dog_Cat_Classification_Deployed

Problem statement :
In this Section we are implementing Convolution Neural Network(CNN) Classifier for Classifying dog and cat images. The Total number of images available for training and Testing is 15000.

Dataset : The dataset is taken from kaggle.

Link to the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishsaxena2209/animal-image-datasetdog-cat-and-panda

Dependencies :

* Jupyter notebook
* Tensorflow 1.10
* Python 3.6
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas
* Numpy
 
You can find all requirments in requirments.txt file. It's important that you should first download or have all of them.

Architecture :
 
 I have created this project for public contribution so as of now I had added only One Convolutional Layer. 
 
 I welcome contrbutors to visit this repo and make updation in architecture and any contribution helpful is accepted.
 
** Note** -  It is possible to Achieve more accuracy on this dataset using deeper network and fine tuning of network parameters for training. You can download this trained model and Play with it.
 
How to run my app :

* Fork this repo in your local system.
* Install requirements.txt in your system.
* Download the dataset you wish to or the one I have provided in same directory.
* Add the dataset address from your local system in cnn.py file.
* Go to terminal and run clientApp.py in it's respective location.

**Note **- I have created my own function for encoding and decoding image into base64 present in utkarsh_utilis. You can use them in this project and in your other projects for deployment stuff.
